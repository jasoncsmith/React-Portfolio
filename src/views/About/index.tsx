          About this site, it is 10 years old and needed some work under the hood. So I rebuilt it with{' '}
          <code>React 18</code> and <code>MobX</code>. The graphics are original, and I had a great time
          creating them back in the day. The biggest design update is that it is now <code>responsive</code>{' '}
          across all devices <small>(go ahead and resize the width of your browser)</small>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would like to call out my <a href="#/work">custom-built fully responsive carousel</a>, written with{' '}
          <code>React</code> and <code>MobX</code>. Other technologies used on this site include:{' '}
          <code>
            Typescript, formik validation, useResizeObserver hook, a custom modal hook, react-pdf,
            react-icons, SASS
          </code>
          , and played with a bit of <code>Tailwind CSS</code>.

          Please take a look around and I encourage you to take a peek under the hood -- link to the source
