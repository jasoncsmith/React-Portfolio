            Whether I am building with hammer and nail or with a keystroke, my objective is to create products
            that last. During my 13 years of software experience building web applications, I have acquired a
            track record of turning complex business needs into innovative, user-centric software.

            I have built software in start-up environments for airlines, manufacturing, insurance, and
            automotive sectors. Each project had its unique product vision and technical challenges. I have
            enjoyed the process of research, collaboration, and networking to take the complex and make it
            look simple. I chose this career because the landscape is always changing, there is always
            something new to learn or a process to improve -- this keeps my over-active mind happy.
